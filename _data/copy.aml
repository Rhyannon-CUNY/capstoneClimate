My grandma turned 100-years-old this year. She was born a year before Marilyn Monroe. 

Summers are so hot now that she can't leave the house. There were a record 29 days above 95°F this year in Tokyo. 100,000 people were taken to hospital for heatstroke.

Days that hot were rare when she was growing up. 

The climate has changed a lot in her lifetime, but how much has it changed since you were born? 

What will it be like when you are 100?
